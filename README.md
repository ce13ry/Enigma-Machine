# Enigma Machine

## Encryption/Decryption machine

## Introduction
The *Enigma Machine* was a German encryption machine used in world war II. It works by including 3 out of a set of 5 possible rotars that each contain 26 different slots, with each slot mapping one key to another. An input key would travel through the rotars, hit a reflector at the end, and travel back through the rotars again, mapping a "trail" where letter 1 would map to letter 2. With each letter that passes through, the rotars shift in a certain way, ensuring that each letter is mapped uniquely depending on its position in the string.

## Purpose
This project will simulate the mechanics behind the *Enigma Machine* but with the option to include an arbitrary number of rotars, increasing the strength of the encryption.

## Who will use it?
Some possible use cases include:
- Sending important information via unsafe networks (bank account passwords)
- A company can use it to encrypt customer's personal information to keep it safe
- Keep backup data safe and secure
- Pass a note on how much you hate your English teacher to your buddy without getting caught

## Why is this project of interest to me
This project is of much interest to me because of the complexity and intricacy of this almost century-old analog machine. The elegancy of this purely physical solution to handling data inspired me to recreate it on a digital device. Loving history also helps :)
